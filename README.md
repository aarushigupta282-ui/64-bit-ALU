# 64-bit-ALU
Complete ASIC design flow of a 64-bit ALU, from RTL (Verilog) through logic synthesis, floorplanning, placement &amp; routing, timing closure, and GDSII generation.

This project implements a **64-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**, designed and verified through the **complete ASIC design flow**, starting from RTL coding to final GDSII layout.

The ALU supports a wide range of **arithmetic and logical operations**, making it a critical component in CPUs, DSPs, and other digital systems. The project demonstrates practical application of **VLSI design principles**, with an emphasis on timing closure, power optimization, and physical design.

### Key Features
- Designed in **Verilog HDL** at RTL level.  
- Verified functionality through **testbenches and waveform simulations**.  
- Synthesized into a gate-level netlist using industry tools.   
- Completed **Place & Route (P&R)** with optimized placement and clock tree synthesis.  
- Generated final **GDSII layout**, which is DRC-clean and LVS-verified.  

### Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Synthesis:** Cadence Genus  
- **Physical Design:** Cadence Innovus   
- **Verification:** DRC, LVS checks
